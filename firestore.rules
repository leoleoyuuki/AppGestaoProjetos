/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the Finestra Financials
 * application. All data is considered private and is accessible only by the user
 * who created it. There is no public or shared data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically under a top-level `users` collection.
 * Each user's data, including their profile, projects, costs, and revenues,
 * is nested under a document corresponding to their unique authentication UID
 * (e.g., /users/{userId}/...). This structure provides a natural security
 * boundary for path-based authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: All rules are scoped to `/users/{userId}`, ensuring users
 *   can only ever access their own data tree.
 * - No Public Access: All operations require user authentication.
 * - User Enumeration Disabled: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is
 *   explicitly forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Authorization Independence: Every document contains a denormalized `userId`
 *   field. This allows security rules to authorize requests without needing slow
 *   and costly `get()` calls to parent documents, making the rules more performant
 *   and secure.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure fast and simple authorization, the owner's `userId` is copied
 * directly onto every document (Projects, PaymentMethods, FixedCosts, CostItems,
 * and RevenueItems). This allows rules to check ownership with a simple field
 * read (e.g., `resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid`) instead of a
 * cross-document `get()`.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The entire data model uses structural segregation. A user's private data is
 * stored in subcollections under their own `/users/{userId}` path. This clean
 * separation ensures that all documents within a given collection path share the
 * same security context, which simplifies rules and client-side queries.
